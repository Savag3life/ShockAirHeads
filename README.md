# Shock AirHeads
A simple but more creative solution to the typical need for an NPC/Citizen. Instead, you can add flare & personality to your features & guide players towards the "shiny" things you want them to interact with.

## Features
- Create unlimited unique AirHeads, put them everywhere!
- Configure each AirHeads animation, appearance, and behavior.
- Lightweight, no dependencies, and easy to use.
- [Hologram Bridge Support](https://github.com/Chubbyduck1/HologramBridge) - Use Holograms, HolographicDisplays, CMI, or DecentHolograms.
- Scale heads up to 10x normal size, and down to 5% of normal size.
- Sends messages, play sounds, dispatch console commands or execute commands as the player.
- Does __not require__ [SVCommonsLib](https://supremeventures.ca/discord)! But you should still check us out :p
